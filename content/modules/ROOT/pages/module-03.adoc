= Module 3: Software Templates and Developer Experience

include::style.adoc[]

== Overview

Software Templates in {product_name_rhdh} enable your team(s) to create Components and - through the use of "actions" provided by plugins - create resources in other systems such as your GitLab and OpenShift GitOps instances. Each Template is stored as an Entity, meaning you can import them similar to any other Entity.

Platform engineers will typically be the authors of Templates, and use them to create "golden paths" that follow best-practices and use approved processes and tooling. Development teams will be the consumers of Templates to create new software. Using Templates reduces cognitive load on the development teams by allowing them to focus on development tasks, while platform concerns are addressed by the template.

Templates are defined using YAML, but are rendered as a rich form in the {product_name_rhdh} UI when used by development teams.

== Module Objectives

* Create a Template (as the Platform Engineer)
* Register the Template in the Software Catalog
* Create a new Component, GitLab Repository, and GitOps Application from the Template (as a Developer)

== Workshop Environment

Your workshop environment has been preconfigured with the following software and platform components:

* Red Hat Build of Keycloak
* OpenShift GitOps
* OpenShift Pipelines
* GitLab

For the purposes of this workshop, we'll assume that your organization has standardized on these tools, and it's your objective as the platform engineer to integrate them with {product_name_rhdh}.

For convenience, {product_name_rhdh} has been predeployed via OpenShift GitOps using the official https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.3/html/installing_red_hat_developer_hub_on_openshift_container_platform/assembly-install-rhdh-ocp-helm[{product_name_rhdh} Helm Chart^, window="_content"]. Specifically, a https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/openshift-gitops/backstage-bootstrap[backstage-bootstrap^, window="_rhdh"] Application has been configured to deploy the official {product_name_rhdh} Helm Chart along with a set prerequisite Secrets and ConfigMaps.


== Introduction to Concepts

For convenience, we've provided a sample Template in the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple[rhdh/template-quarkus-simple^, window="_gitlab"] repository in GitLab. Let's explore the Template structure.

=== Template YAML Structure

At a basic level, the Template is similar to the Component Entity you encountered in the _catalog-info.yaml_ in the prior module; resembling a Kubernetes Custom Resource Definition.

```yaml
apiVersion: scaffolder.backstage.io/v1beta3
kind: Template
metadata:
  name: quarkus-web-template
  title: Quarkus Service
  description: Create a simple microservice using Quarkus with ArgoCD
  tags:
    - recommended
    - java
    - quarkus
    - maven
spec:
  owner: rhdh
  type: service
  # other fields removed for brevity
```

Where the Template Entity differs is that it contains additional fields:

* spec.parameters
* spec.steps
* spec.output

=== Parameters

The _spec.parameters_ field is used by platform engineers to enable developers to customise the output of the Template. Typically this customisation will be limited to parameters such as the name of the Component, Java package name, repository name, etc.

Here's an example of the parameters:

```yaml
spec:
  parameters:
    # Parameters can be spread across multiple forms/pages, each
    # with their own titles and set of parameters
    - title: Provide Information for Application
      required:
        - component_id
        - java_package_name
      properties:
        component_id:
          title: Name
          type: string
          description: Unique name of the component
          default: my-quarkus-app
          ui:field: EntityNamePicker
          ui:autofocus: true
          maxLength: 18
        group_id:
          title: Group Id
          type: string
          default: com.redhat.rhdh
          description: Maven Group Id
```

You might have recognized this as a https://json-schema.org/[JSON Schema] structure. By using JSON Schema you can define the parameters that are supported by the template, and more importantly, enforce validation on those parameters. The rendering of the form in the {product_name_rhdh} UI is managed by the https://github.com/rjsf-team/react-jsonschema-form[react-jsonschema-form^, window="_content"] library.


.Click to learn: What is `react-jsonschema-form`?
[%collapsible]
====

* This library is a React component for building Web forms from JSON Schema, and is core to the frontend part of the scaffolder plugin.
* It  is responsible for rendering the form in which developers and end users fill out data needed to use the Software Template.

====

The properties that have a `ui` prefix might have piqued your interest. These are special properties that provide instructions to the form, for example to enable autocomplete or autofocus certain form fields when it is displayed in the {product_name_rhdh} UI.

TODO: 

* Discuss Quay and OpenShift as repositories
* Discuss why the template need dev to create a Quay account
* Best practices about this isolated dev environment being created  in developer's personal git repo and personal Quay
* Because this template is meant for experimental purposes and not meant for production. 


=== Steps

Once a developer has entered and confirmed their parameters, the Template is executed by the scaffolder - a service within the {product_name_rhdh} backend.

The scaffolder executes the actions defined in _spec.steps_, for example to publish code to a Git repository and register it in the Software Catalog:

```yaml
spec:
  steps:
  - id: publish
    name: Publish
    # Use the publish action provided by the GitLab plugin
    action: publish:gitlab
    input:
      # Construct a URL to the repository using the provided hostname, logged in
      # username, and provided component_id
      repoUrl: "${{ parameters.repo.host }}?owner=${{ user.entity.metadata.name }}&repo=${{parameters.component_id}}"
      repoVisibility: public
      defaultBranch: main
      sourcePath: ./${{ user.entity.metadata.name }}-${{parameters.component_id}}
  - id: register
    name: Register
    # Register a new component using the built-in register action
    action: catalog:register
    input:
      repoContentsUrl: ${{ steps.publish.output.repoContentsUrl }}
      catalogInfoPath: "/catalog-info.yaml"
```

== Platform Engineer Activity: Import the Software Template

The Software Template you'll be using in this activity is stored in the _template.yaml_ file in the https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-kccz6.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple[rhdh/template-quarkus-simple, window="_gitlab"] repository in GitLab.

Register this template using the {product_name_rhdh} UI:

. Login to your https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[instance of {product_name_rhdh}] as the `pe1` user.
. Select *Create* from the sidemenu.
. Click the *Register Existing Component* button.
+
image::./m3/rhdh-catalog-create.png[The empty Create UI]
. Enter the following URL in the *Select URL* field and click *Analyze*:
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/-/blob/main/template.yaml?ref_type=heads
----
. You'll be asked to review the entities being imported, as shown:
+
image::./m3/rhdh-register-template.png[Registering and Entity]
. Click *Import* when prompted.

Return to the Software Catalog and set the _Kind_ filter to _Template_. Your new *Quarkus Service* template will be listed. Clicking on the template reveals that it looks a lot like the Component Entity you imported in the previous module.

== Developer Activity: Developer On-Boarding Example

Until now, you've been acting in the role of a platform engineer. Let's switch persona to that of a developer: `dev1`. 

=== Login to {product_name_rhdh} as a Developer

. Navigate to the *Settings* side-menu and click on th kebab menu in the *Profile* card
+
image::./m3/rhdh-settings.png[Settings of {product_name_rhdh}]
. Sign out of {product_name_rhdh} using the Settings screen as shown.
+
image::./m3/rhdh-sign-out.png[Signing out of {product_name_rhdh}]

. Login to {product_name_rhdh} as `dev1` using the password `{common_password}`. 

=== Create an Account in Quay

You'll need an account in Quay to push your developers container images to.

. Visit the https://quay.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Quay Registry^, window="_quay"] deployed in your workshop environment.
. Click the *Create Account* link.
+
image::./m3/quay-create-account-link.png[Creating a Quay Account, width="60%"]
. Enter the following information:
  * Username: `dev1`
  * Email: `dev1@rhdh.com`
  * Password: {common_password}
+
image::./m3/quay-create-account.png[Creating a Quay Account]
. Click *Create Account*.

Now you're ready to create an application from a Template!

== Developer Activity: Create a new Component from the Template

Create a new software Component and supporting infrastructure using the *Quarkus Service* template that was created by the platform engineer:

. Make sure you've logged in to {product_name_rhdh} as `dev1` using the password `{common_password}`.
. Select the *Create* item from the sidemenu.
+
image::./m3/rhdh-create.png[The {product_name_rhdh} Create UI]
. Click the *Choose* button on the *Quarkus Service*. The *Software Templates* screen will be displayed.
. You'll be prompted to enter a set of application parameters. Thankfully defaults are provided by the template, so you can simply click *Next*.
. When prompted to *Provide Image Registry Information*:
  * Select the *Quay* image registry.
  * Enter your Quay password: `{common_password}`
  * Click *Next*.
+
NOTE: Your username is automatically determined by the Template using your current session.
. Select the default *Repository Location* and click *Review*.
+
image::./m3/rhdh-template-review.png[Reviewing template parameters in {product_name_rhdh}]
. Confirm you're satisfied with your parameters and click *Create*. 

After a few moments the process should be finished, and you'll see a screen with a series of green checkmarks.

== Platform Engineer Activity: Enhance the Template & Component with Plugins

Currently, it's not possible for the developer to see the deployment status of the Argo CD application that was created when they used the Template to create their Quarkus application. Let's fix that using the Argo CD plugin to display the status of Argo CD application in the Component view in the Software Catalog.

=== Install the Argo CD Plugins

. Visit the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[rhdh/developer-hub-config/values.yaml] file.
. Add the following entries to the `dynamic.plugins` list:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/roadiehq-backstage-plugin-argo-cd-backend-dynamic
  disabled: false
- package: ./dynamic-plugins/dist/backstage-community-plugin-redhat-argocd
  disabled: false
----
. Add the following plugin configuration as a child of the `backstage.appConfig`:
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
argocd:
  appLocatorMethods:
    - type: 'config'
      instances:
        - name: main
          url: https://rhdh-gitops-server-rhdh-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}
          username: admin
          password: ${ARGOCD_PASSWORD}
----
. Verify your `argocd` plugin configuration resembles the following screenshot.
+
image::./m3/argocd-plugin-config.png[Argo CD Plugin Configuration Example]
. Click Refresh on the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications[`backstage` Application in OpenShift GitOps^, window="_blank"]. 

You might have noticed that the `url` provided to the Argo CD plugin doesn't match the URL of the Argo CD instance you've been using to manage your {product_name_rhdh} deployment. That's because your environment contains two separate instances of OpenShift GitOps; one to manage platform components, and another to manage applications.

The `${ARGOCD_PASSWORD}` is a reference to an environment variable provided by the `argocd-password` Secret referenced in the `backstage.extraEnvVarsSecrets` configuration.

=== Update the Software Template & Quarkus Application

Installing the Argo CD plugin won't automatically make the deployment information available when viewing the Component in the Software Catalog. An `argocd/app-selector` annotation must be added to the Component. This annotation instructs the plugin to fetch the correct information from the Argo CD instance you configured.

Start by updating your Quarkus application with the correct annotation:

. Visit the https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/pe1/my-quarkus-app/-/blob/main/catalog-info.yaml[dev1/my-quarkus-app/catalog-info.yaml] file in GitLab.
. Select _Edit > Edit single file_.
. Add the following annotation:
+
----
argocd/app-selector: rht-gitops.com/rhdh-gitops=dev1-my-quarkus-app
----
. You can confirm this annotation is correct by visiting the https://rhdh-gitops-server-rhdh-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/rhdh-gitops/dev1-my-quarkus-app-dev[dev1-my-quarkus-app-dev in the rhdh-gitops instance] and clicking the *Details* button.
+
image::./m3/argocd-label.png[Argo CD Details with Labels]
. Use the *Commit changes* button to commit the annotation.

Return to your developer hub instance after committing the change. Use the *Schedule entity refresh* button to pull this change from Git to {product_name_rhdh}. 

image::./m3/rhdh-entity-refresh.png[Entity Refresh Button]

Next, refresh your browser. The *CD* tab should appear, and you can view build information.
