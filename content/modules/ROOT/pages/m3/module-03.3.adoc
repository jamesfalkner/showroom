== Developer Activity: Developer On-Boarding Example

include::../style.adoc[]

Until now, you've been acting in the role of a platform engineer. Let's switch persona to that of a developer: `dev1`. 

Let's assume that this developer needs to create a development environment to work on a new feature - we can use a Software Template to assist with this this task. A prerequisite to using this template is that the developer has a Quay account, so their code can be built into a container image and pushed to an image registry for storage and scanning. 

While OpenShift has a built-in image registry, there are various reasons we're using Quay as our image registry:

* Security scanning for container images via Clair.
* Support for image signing and trust policies.
* Vulnerability detection with detailed reports.
* RBAC and repository/organisation permissions.
* Better suited for multi-tenant and multi-cluster environments.

=== Login to {product_name_rhdh} as a Developer

. Navigate to the *Settings* side-menu and click on the kebab menu in the *Profile* card

. Sign out of {product_name_rhdh} using the Settings screen as shown.

. Login to {product_name_rhdh} as `dev1` using the password `{common_password}`. 

=== Create an Account in Quay

You'll need an account in Quay to push your developer's container images to.

. Visit the https://quay.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[Quay Registry^, window="quay"] deployed in your workshop environment.
. Click the *Create Account* link.

. Enter the following information:
  * Username: `dev1`
  * Email: `dev1@rhdh.com`
  * Password: {common_password}

. Click *Create Account*.

You're almost ready to create an application from a Template!
