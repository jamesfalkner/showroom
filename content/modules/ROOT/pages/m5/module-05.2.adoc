== Explore updates to Production Argo Manifests

* In the previous section, we noted that a PR has been raised on the Prod Argo manifest to update the prod image
* On Developer Hub, in the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store[`parasol-store` component, window="rhdh"] overview page, you can view the *Deployment Summary* section
* Click on the Revision link shown for `parasol-store-prod`. This will take you to the `parasol-store-manifests` repo showing the commits.

NOTE: In ArgoCD, open the *parasol-store* deployment, and you can validate that the image deployed on Prod is the same image as in Dev and Staging that we saw earlier.

== Conclusion

A developer can easily setup a isolated dev environment, develop and test their code, and then the code can be progressed till Production with all the necessary guardrails in place.

All of this is possible, from a single-pane of glass on Red Hat Developer Hub, without the developer having to move across different tools and platforms to view the inner-loop and outer-loop progress and statuses.
