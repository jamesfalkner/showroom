* Since this merge request is to the `parasol-store` component, the `parasol-store-build-pr-open` pipeline gets triggered and can viewed in the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store/ci[`parasol-store` component, window="rhdh"]

* Once the pipeline completes, make note of the final task `gitlab-update-task`, which updates the Gitlab's Merge Request with status of the pipeline
+

* This status update can be visible in the Merge Request page. Note that the Pipeline is marked as _Passed_ and ready to be merged

* Navigate back to the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store/-/merge_requests[Merge Request page, window="gitlab"] and open the request that you created earlier; Click on the *Merge* button.
