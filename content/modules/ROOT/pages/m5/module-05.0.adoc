include::../style.adoc[]

== Overview

* To handle the outer-loop, Platform Engineer has built a production-level pipelines (pre and post merge) based org needs via Tekton
* Developer creates a new merge-request, the pre-merge pipeline is triggered via Gitlab webhook, and the image is built
* An application owner/team member reviews and accepts the merge-request.
* This kicks off a post-merge pipeline which updates manifests in Dev and Stage env 
* This also issues a merge-request to deploy to the Production Environment. 
* Once this prod merge-request is accepted, the application is deployed to production through GitOps/ArgoCD
