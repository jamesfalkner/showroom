= Module 4.3: Setup Developer Sandbox

include::style.adoc[]

A developer is assigned a JIRA to enhance the Parasol application, and they begin to work on the `parasol-store` application. To begin, they will create a branch of the `parasol-store` repo  on gitlab, and work on this _feature-branch_ till the time they are ready to merge their changes to the main branch. This will where the developer writes test all changes in an isolated sandbox code in a continuous loop.

So as to help the developer continue to work on the enhancement, the Platform Engineer creates a new S/W template that can setup a Sandbox environment for the Developer for this `parasol-store` application. The template performs a number of things

* Creates GitOps/Argo manifests within the user's repo
* Sets up a development pipelines to make development easy 
* The  Sandbox connects to the *developer* DB instance 

With this, the Platform Engineers are able to provide an environment that allows the developer to just focus on coding. The templates make it easy for developers to set up sandboxes repeatedly in a self-service fashion.


== Platform Engineer: Onboard parasol-store Dev Template

* To help developers to be able to accelerate development through RHDH, the PE creates a new template with  parasol-store-dev-template.

=== Create a branch 
* On RHDH, choose *Create* menu on the left-hand, and choose *Register Existing Component*.
* Create a template by pasting this template URL into the *URL* textbox 
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/parasol-store-dev-template/-/blob/main/template.yaml
----
* Click on *Analyze* button followed by clicking the *Import* button to import the template.

== App Developer: Onboard parasol-store Dev Template

* Click here to access the repo https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store
* Click on the *(+)* button as shown in the screenshot below, and click on *New branch* menu
+

* Name the branch as `my-feature-branch` so as to make it easier to follow the rest of the instructions
+

=== Onboard the Feature Branch using template

* In {product_name_rhdh}, choose the *Create* side-menu, and you will see the *Parasol Store Development* template. Click on *Choose*

image:./m4/choose-parasol-store-template.png[width=30%]

* In *Step 1: Provide Information for the sandbox deployment*
** Enter the feature-branch name `my-feature-branch` or the name you have picked for your branch.

* In *Step 2: Provide database information*
** Keep all the fields as it is - no need to make changes. The parameters are already set based on the OpenShift Service names from the existing deployments of the application

image:./m4/choose-parasol-store-template-step2.png[]

* Click on *Review*, and proceed to *Create*

image:./m4/choose-parasol-store-template-step3.png[]

* Click on the *Open component on catalog* link

image:./m4/parasol-branch-component.png[]

** You can see under the *CI* tab, a pipeline is already running 
+
image:./m4/parasol-branch-first-pipeline.png[]
+
and turns green when it finishes the run successfully
+
image:./m4/parasol-branch-first-pipeline-success.png[]

** Explore the other tabs to see how RHDH allows a single pane of glass for the Developers' Sandbox environment

* If you are curious to view the deployment on OpenShift: https://console-openshift-console.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/k8s/ns/parasol-store-my-feature-branch/apps%7Ev1%7EDeployment[click here^, window="_console"]

=== Enhancing the application

* Click on the *< > View Source* button on the Component Overview page to open the source repository
+
image:./m4/parasol-branch-component-overview.png[]

* Switch to the *my-feature-branch* 
+
image:./m4/parasol-switchbranch.png[]

* Click on the Web IDE of the *my-feature-branch* to access the code via the inbuilt editor
+
image:./m4/parasol-webide.png[]

* For the sake of the workshop, let us make some changes to the README file. +
E.g. add this text to the README file `This service store provides the core services of Parasol web-app`

* Click on the *Source Control* menu on the left-hand (highlighted below), add a Commit Message *Chore: Improved README file*, and click the *Commit and push to "my-feature-branch"* button
+
image:./m4/parasol-webide-paste-commit.png[width=80%]
* You can now close the gitlab browser.

=== View component on RHDH
* In RHDH, navigate to the `parasol-store` component. You can https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store/ci[click here^, window="_rhdh"] to access it.
*  Access the CI tab  to view the pipeline
+
image:./m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline1.png[width=80%]

* Very shortly, the pipeline will be marked as *Succeeded*
+
image:./m4/parasol-innerloop-pipeline-ok.png[width=80%]
+
NOTE: The first pipeline was triggered when you registered using the s.w template. and the next is by git commit

* Once you are happy with the changes, you are now ready to create a merge request to the main branch.

* This is the end of development within the Sandbox. In the next section, the developer will create merge request to the main branch, to initiate the outer loop
