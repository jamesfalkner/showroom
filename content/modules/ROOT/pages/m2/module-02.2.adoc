== {product_name_rhdh} Deployment

=== Deploying {product_name_rhdh}

Platform Engineers can deploy {product_name_rhdh} on OpenShift using the Operator or Helm Chart. Both of these installation methods are outlined in the https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_developer_hub/1.3/html/installing_red_hat_developer_hub_on_openshift_container_platform/index#assembly-install-rhdh-ocp-helm[{product_name_rhdh} documentation]. In this lab you'll use the Helm Chart to deploy and manage your instance of {product_name_rhdh}. The source code for this Helm Chart can be found at https://github.com/openshift-helm-charts/charts/tree/main/charts/redhat/redhat/redhat-developer-hub[openshift-helm-charts repository on GitHub].

=== Using GitOps to Manage {product_name_rhdh}

The instance of OpenShift Container Platform used in this workshop environment has been preconfigured with OpenShift GitOps (Argo CD). Your deployment of {product_name_rhdh} is kept up to date using a GitOps workflow, as illustrated below.

Since this isn't a GitOps-focused workshop, we've setup the basic GitOps workflow ahead of time. Specifically we've pre-created a https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/openshift-gitops/backstage-bootstrap[backstage-bootstrap Application in OpenShift GitOps, window="argo"] - you can view this by clicking the link and logging in as the `admin` user with the password `{openshift_gitops_password}`.

The https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/openshift-gitops/backstage-bootstrap[backstage-bootstrap, window="argo"] Application creates Secrets, ConfigMaps, and another Application named https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/openshift-gitops/backstage[backstage, window="argo"]. The https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/openshift-gitops/backstage[backstage, window="argo"] Application deploys {product_name_rhdh} using the Helm Chart. The configuration values passed to the Helm Chart are sourced from the https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-wwbcz.wwbcz.sandbox1079.opentlc.com/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[rhdh/developer-hub-config/values.yaml file in GitLab, window="gitlab"]. OpenShift GitOps will detect changes to this file and redeploy {product_name_rhdh} in response. You can see these two sources in the *Details* tab of the `backstage` Application as shown.

=== Platform Engineer Activity: Verify GitOps is Working

Let's verify that changes to the https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-wwbcz.wwbcz.sandbox1079.opentlc.com/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[values.yaml file in GitLab, window="gitlab"] actually get rolled out by OpenShift GitOps.

. Open your https://gitlab-gitlab.apps.cluster-wwbcz.wwbcz.sandbox1079.opentlc.com/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/blob/main/values.yaml[values.yaml file, window="gitlab"].
. Select *Edit > Edit single file*.
. Find the YAML surrounded by `--- APP TITLE ---` and uncomment it by highlighting it and pressing `CMD + /` or `CTRL + /`.

. Scroll down and enter a commit message `feat: change application title`.
. Click the *Commit changes* button.

Return to the https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/applications/openshift-gitops/backstage[backstage, window="argo"] Application in Argo CD. Depending on your timing it might already be progressing the latest sync, but if not, click the *Refresh* button. When the sync is in progress you'll see a new Pod starting - this Pod will run the latest version of your configuration.

Once the new Pod has started, visit your https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[{product_name_rhdh} instance, window="rhdh"]. You should see the new title in the page header.
