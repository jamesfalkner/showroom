NOTE: You can easily test and try it out by going to your https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=redhat.fabric8-analytics[VSCode] or https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/12541-red-hat-dependency-analytics[IntelliJ] Marketplace (check the links) and run it on code you have on your laptop. Below you'll find how to follow the workshop examples.


To reproduce the examples further below in this chapter, please clone the parasol-store application: 

* Navigate to the https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/catalog/default/component/parasol-store[parasol store component, window="rhdh"] in {product_name_rhdh}. If prompted, login as `dev1` / `{common_password}`.
* Click on the *View Source* link to access the git repo of this Component.
* Copy the *HTTPS* URL (this environment hasn't been setup to allow ssh connections to GitLab)
** Based on your local setup (mime-types configured) you can also try to open it directly in your preferred IDE

Then, use `git clone` to download it.

Or, for your convenience, use this:
[source,bash,role=execute,subs=attributes+]
----
git clone https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/parasol-store.git
----

When you open this repository, your IDE will automatically activate required plugins (VSCode) or ask you to activate them (IntelliJ), including Red Hat Dependency Analytics. 

By including `.vscode/extensions.json` and `.idea/externalDependencies.xml` to the repository, the developer's IDE will have the plugins that support them doing their job - in this case, identifying possible vulnerabilities via `redhat.fabric8-analytics` (VSCode) and `org.jboss.tools.intellij.analytics` (IntelliJ), respectively.

TIP: As Platform Engineers, we can support our developers by adding appropriate plugin configuration to the Red Hat Developer Hub templates we provide them with. If you go back to xref:m3/module-03.0.adoc[Chapter 3], where we introduced templates, or take a look at the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/template-quarkus-simple/-/tree/main/skeleton["skeleton" part of the simple template] (the "code skeleton"), you can see that we included these files there as well. This way, you can add IDE plugins based on programming language, framework, etc - to make lives easier for developers starting new projects or components.
