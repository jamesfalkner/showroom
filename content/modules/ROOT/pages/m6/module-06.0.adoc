= Module 6: Software Supply Chain Security

include::../style.adoc[]

== Overview

//TODO What is Software Supply Chain Security and how does it affect
//Platform Engineers
//Developers

== Objectives
// MVP
// PE adds signing to post-merge pipeline (this image tag is the one being used, pre-merge is discarded)
// PE adds signature verification to prod deployment pipeline
// PE adds .vscode/extensions.json to codebase with RHDA
// For DEVs --> optional task, since local VSCode or IntelliJ required: Show RHDA results and interaction.


// Step 2
// PE adds provenance metadata to build process & provenance verification (Enterprise Contract / Conforma policies) to prod deployment pipeline

// Step 3
// PE adds image scanning & policy checks to pre-merge pipeline (ACS required)
// PE configures ACS policies-as-code
// PE configures Admission Controller (showcase ACS & sigstore Admission controller)

// Step 4
// Continuous monitoring of templates (scaffolder code) for vulnerable dependencies.



//// 
* SecOps is alerted about a compromised library
* PE runs a vulnerability scan to detect which applications are affected, and whom to contact.
* Affected teams are alerted need to issue fixes asap.
* PE checks existing software templates for the detected vulnerabilities.
* Changes are rolled out to RHDH Software Template catalogue if needed
* ( Policy Exception request for a low severity issue may be approved by SecOps)
