Click https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/import-existing-api-template/-/blob/main/template.yaml[here^] to view the `import-existing-app` Software Template

This template does the following things.

*Section 1: Gather the following details*


```yaml
  #  The `parameters` section defines the data gathered from the user
  parameters:
    # Git repo details about where this API Envelope repo lives
    - title: Provide information about Catalog Envelope to which API will be included
      properties:
        gitlabHost:

    # Details about the API that needs to be imported
    - title: Provide information about your existing API
      properties:
        gitlabOrganization:
        repositoryName:
        #Path to where API spec is defined
