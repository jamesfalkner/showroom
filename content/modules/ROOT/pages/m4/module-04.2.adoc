== Platform Engineer Activity: Setup Software Templates Import Existing API/Apps

include::../style.adoc[]

Platform Engineering team creates two templates for importing existing Apps/Services and APIs into Developer Hub. While it is possible to use the same template to import both of them, there are some key differences in data gathered. As best practice, Platform Engg team creates as many Software Templates as necessary to assist developers.

include::../login-pe.adoc[]

== Register the Import API/App Software Templates

Since you have already learnt how to create a Software Template, we will walk through a template that has been built for you. 

Click https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/import-existing-api-template/-/blob/main/template.yaml[here^, window="_gitlab"] to view the `import-existing-app` Software Template

This template does the following:

. Gather details of the API, the target location of catalog info and the details of the software component
+

. Update the *_Envelope* location file with the details as a two step process
+
image:m4/st-api-steps.png[width=70%]

+
.Why are there 2 merge requests?
[%collapsible]
====
Gitlab allows only one type of action (such as Amend/Update) in a given Merge Request (MR). Therefore, we need a one MR to _create_ the the new catalog-info and TechDocs file, and another MR to _update_ the envelope location file with a reference to the catalog-info.yaml file
====

=== Register Import API Software Template

* Access Red Hat Developer Hub (https://backstage-backstage.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[click here^, window="_rhdh"]) and login using `pe1/{common_password}`
* Click on the Create menu on the left-hand navigation. 
+
image::m4/nav-create.png[]
* Click on the `Register Existing Component` button on the top-right of the page to launch the *Register an existing component* wizard 
+
image::m4/nav-register-wizard.png[]
* Paste the following URL into the `Select URL` field and click on *Analyze* button. This URL points to Software Template's https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/import-existing-api-template/-/blob/main/template.yaml[template.yaml, window="gitlab"] file.
+ 
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/import-existing-api-template/-/blob/main/template.yaml
----
* Review, and Import the template by clicking on the *Import* button
+
image::m4/nav-register-import.png[]

* The  *import-api-catalog* Template is successfully registered
+
image::m4/nav-access-api-template.png[]

=== Register Import App Software Template

* Let us now register the import-app template as well similar to the *Import API* template.
* Click *Create* (left hand nav) -> *Register Existing Component* (top right)
* Paste the following URL 
+
[source,bash,role=execute,subs="attributes"]
----
https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/import-existing-app-template/-/blob/main/template.yaml
----
* Review, and Import the template by clicking on the *Import* button

=== View the imported templates

* Navigate back to *Create* (left hand nav) and you should be able to see both the templates for importing APIs and Apps to Developer hub

== Setup Developer Hub config

=== Enable Dynamic Plugins 

. The Import API/APP templates described above need a couple of Dynamic Plugins. 

.. The _roadiehq-scaffolder-backend-module-utils-dynamic_ plugin helps in manipulating file system, and in this case helps in update the the Catalog Envelope file with references to the new component being imported.
.. The _backstage-plugin-catalog-backend-module-gitlab-dynamic_ plugin helps to discover catalog files located in your GitLab instance. 

. You will also enable a couple of Community plugins which will help view Merge requests and Issues from Gitlab
+
.What are Dynamic Plugins?
[%collapsible]
====
The Red Hat Developer Hub application offers a unified platform with various plugins. Plugins extend functionality, streamline development workflows, and improve the developer experience. You can add and configure plugins in RHDH to access various software development tools. RHDH provides both static and dynamic plugins that enhance its functionality. Static plugins are integrated into the core of the RHDH application, while dynamic plugins can be side-loaded into your Developer Hub instance without the need to recompile your code or rebuild the container.
====
. Visit your https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/developer-hub-config/-/edit/main/values.yaml[rhdh/developer-hub-config repository on GitLab^, window="_gitlab"]. If prompted, login using (pe1/{common_password}).
. You should already be in Edit mode of the `values.yaml` file.
. Locate the comment `--- DYNAMIC_PLUGINS_IMPORT_COMPONENTS ---`
. Highlight the YAML section shown in the below screenshot, and uncomment those lines. Type _CMD+/ or CTRL+/_ command to do so.
+
image::m4/uncomment-dynamic-plugin.png[width=60%]
. Don't commit the changes yet. We need to next turn on auto-discovery

=== Turn on auto-discovery
. Locate the comment _--- AUTO_DISCOVERY_IMPORT_COMPONENTS ---_ in the same values.yaml file.
. Highlight the YAML as shown in the below screenshot, and comment those lines. Type _CMD+/ or CTRL+/_ command to do so.
+
image::m4/uncomment-auto-discovery.png[width=60%]
+
NOTE: This YAML snippet enables auto-discovery for all files named _envelope.yaml_ [entityFilename] where the repo name starts with the word _envelope_ [projectPattern]. The Catalog Envelope for Parasol is called _envelope-catalog-parasol_
. Go ahead and commit the file now using the *Commit Changes* button at the bottom of the page with a suitable commit message.

== Refresh Developer Hub on Argo

Argo is tuned to pull changes from the repo every two minutes or so. Instead of waiting for the sync to kick in, you can *Refresh* the RHDH Argo Application as follows:

* Access ArgoCD from https://openshift-gitops-server-openshift-gitops.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}[ here^, window="_argo"], and login as (admin/{openshift_gitops_password})
* Click on the *Refresh* button of the *backstage* stage to trigger a refresh; this will sync the content from Gitlab.

* Wait till the app turns green and marked as Healthy. 


== Onboard Parasol's System and Domain

In a previous chapter you learnt about how System and Domain help in organizing the components in {product_name_rhdh}. In this section you will setup Parasol's System and Domain

. From {product_name_rhdh}, navigate to Create menu; choose *Register Existing Component* button
. Paste the below URL and click on *Analyze*
+
[source,yaml,subs=attributes+]
----
https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/rhdh/rhdh-entities/-/blob/main/locations.yaml
----
. Click *Import* in the Review section.
. The Systems and Domain are setup.
