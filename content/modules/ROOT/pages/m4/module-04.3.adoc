* You can navigate to the https://gitlab-gitlab.{openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/parasol/envelope-parasol-catalog[envelope-parasol-catalog repo, window="gitlab"] to see that the API's catalog-info has been added to the envelope.yaml file, and under the `parasol-store-api` folder docs and catalog-info.yaml are created.
* In a few minutes, the Parasol API that you just imported will appear in the API section automatically. This is because of the auto-discover feature that you had enabled in the previous steps
+

** Click on `parasol-store-api` and explore the component. The *Docs* tab displays the skeleton techdocs that was added.
** More interestingly the *Definition* tab showcases the OpenAPI spec nicely formatted. This is due to the fact that you selected `openapi` as the API type while importing the API.
