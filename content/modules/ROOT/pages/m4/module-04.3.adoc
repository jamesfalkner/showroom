* Click on both the URLs and merge the requests

* Open the envelope-parasol-catalog repo
* URL to the catalog-info has been added to the envelope

* Under the parasol-store-api folder docs and catalog-info.yaml are created

* In a few minutes you will notice that this API automatically starts appearing in the APIs section

* This is because of the Autodiscovery feature of RHDH 



=== Gitlab Merge Requests 

. The wizard is complete and you are presented with two Merge Requests
+

=== View the component in RHDH API

In a few minutes the API you just imported will start appearing in the API section of RHDH automatically. This is because of the auto-discover feature that you had enabled in the previous steps

=== Explore the `parasol-store` component in RHDH Catalog section

In a few minutes the `parasol-store` Component you just imported will start appearing in the Catalog section of RHDH automatically. This is because of the auto-discover feature that you had enabled in the previous steps

Click on the `parasol-store` link to view the component. You can step through each of the tabs to see how RHDH provides a single pane of glass to see

* Topology showing the deployments on OpenShift
* CI showing *Pipeline Runs* is currently empty, because there are no pipeline runs yet.
* CD tab showing the deployed components/systems using ArgoCD plugin
* Api tab showing the Consume API `parasol-store-api`
* View docs

TODO: walk through catalog-info.yaml

 

== [Optional] Onboard parasol-web

You can now optionally import the `parasol-web` component as well.

* The org is `parasol`
* Repo for parasol-web is `parasol-web`
